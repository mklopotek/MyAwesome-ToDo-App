Hi! Every respected beginner programmer should create 'To Do App'
====================================
So do I! :)

You can: 
-add/delete your task, 
-filter task by completed/uncompleted/text

The app is connected with firebase database so you can sign up and login or login by Google. 

Happy using! :)
